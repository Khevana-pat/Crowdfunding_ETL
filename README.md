# Crowdfunding_ETL

This project focuses on Extracting, Transforming and Loading Crowdfunding data. We built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods expressions to extract and transform the data. Once the data was transformed, we created four CSV files (campaign.csv, contacts.csv, category.csv and subcategory.csv) and used the CSV file data to create an ERD (crowdfunding_db_schema.sql.png) and a table schema (crowdfunding_db.sql). Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
